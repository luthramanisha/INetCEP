Excercise
=========

## 1. Installation
Follow the instructions of the README to install and run nfn-scala as well as ccn-lite.

## 2. Basic Scala

## 3. Look trhough the programs of `PaperExperiment` and try to understand how the topology is setup with the help of `LocalNode`, how nodes are connected (manual setup of the routing information), how documents are added to the network and how the services are distributed. Also try to understand the LambdaDSL and the simple programs for the experiments.

## 4. Create your own (local) topology and add documents to some nodes. Add WordCountService to some nodes and test your setup with some small word count programs. The omnet visualization can be used to replay the executed programs. Dont forget that you have to register prefixes and do all the routing manually! Feel free to automate this process and send a pull request :)

## 5. Create a new service which allows to compress arbitrary data using the Lempel–Ziv–Welch algorithm. Write a small program for your topology using this service.


## 6. Think about another application domain which could profit or make use of nfn. Try to implemented it as far as possible! If you cannot implement it for some reasons explain where the issues are.
