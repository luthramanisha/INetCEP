To launch the test of the Keep Alive version of the fetchContent function:

1. Make sure the environment variable NFN_HOME points to the root 
   folder of the nfn-scala project.
2. Enable the following services in the ComputeServerStarter:
   WordCount, DelayedWordCount, FetchContentTest
3. Compile ccn-lite using USE_TIMEOUT_KEEPALIVE.
4. Launch the nodes A-F using the scripts [a-f].sh
5. Launch the compute servers using server_[d|f].sh
6. Set up all faces using mgmt.sh
7. Send the following interest:

$CCNL_HOME/bin/ccn-lite-simplenfn -s ndn2013 -u 127.0.0.1/9001 -w 10 "(call 2 /node/nodeD/nfn_service_FetchContentTest (call 2 /node/nodeF/nfn_service_WordCount 'foo bar'))" | $CCNL_HOME/bin/ccn-lite-pktdump

This interest will cause the WordCount service on node F 
to be launched with the argument 'foo bar', which returns 2.
Then, the FetchContentTest service is launched on node D.
This service uses fetchContent to send a new interest,
calling the DelayedWordCount service with the results of the
nested interest (2), which returns 1 after a while (while
the interest is kept alive in the fetchContent function).
