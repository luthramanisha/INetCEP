To launch the n-body simulation test:

1. Make sure the environment variable NFN_HOME points to the root 
   folder of the nfn-scala project.
2. Enable the following services in the ComputeServerStarter:
   NBody_SimulationService, NBody_RenderService
3. Install the PyNDN python library:
      https://github.com/named-data/PyNDN2
4. Install the Pillow python image library: 
      pip install Pillow
5. Compile ccn-lite using USE_TIMEOUT_KEEPALIVE.
6. Launch the nodes A-D using the scripts [a-d].sh
7. Launch the compute server using server.sh
8. Set up all faces using mgmt.sh
9. Execute SimpleClient.py

The client will receive roughly 1 intermediate result per
second and print the data to stdout. After receiving the 
final result, the render service is used to obtain a PNG
rendering of the results. This image is displayed with the 
default image viewing program (it is converted to a bitmap
by the image output library on the client).
